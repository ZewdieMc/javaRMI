The directories:
	Client
	Server
	
	contain the code for simple RMI application and refer, respectively, to the Client  module and the   		Server module.
	
	A remote interface is copied to both the server and client modules in this case, but it can be    added to each module without the need to copy it by adding a library reference of its .jar file.
